### Community Note

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Agentic Community! We're looking forward to working with you on your awesome new idea. To get started with a new repository, we need some information first:

<!--- The name of the repository --->
Repository Name:

<!--- A description of what the repository will contain --->
Repository Description:

<!--- Code must adhere to Apache 2.0 and include the Apache 2.0 license --->
- [ ] This repository is licensed under Apache 2.0

<!--- Which working group will be accepting this repository --->
Working Group:

Once this ticket is open, make sure you share it with the lead of the working group so they can sign off on it. They will then bring it to the Steering Committee for signoff and add a comment here, then we will request that Amazon create the repository. In the meantime, if your organization allows, you can continue working on the repository in your own personal/organization space. When the time comes, we can transfer the repository.

Thank you for your contribution!
