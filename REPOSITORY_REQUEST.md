# Agentic Community Repository Process

As an Amazon-led community initiative, we aim to formalize a process for repository creation. The Agentic Community
GitHub organization should be treated as a community organization, necessitating the creation of repositories
collectively.

Given that the Agentic Community is not an independent organization but an initiative stewarded by Amazon, we must
adhere to Amazon’s open source guidelines and repository creation processes. To this end, we propose a streamlined
process to enhance community collaboration and expedite contributions to the Agentic Community:

**New Repository Requests from community members:**

- New repository requests should be initiated as GitHub issue using the "Repository Request" template.
- The requester should document the repository’s purpose and objectives.
- The repository request should be approved by the working group lead that will maintain it.
- The community steering committee should then approve it by majority.
- Community approval is required before repository creation to ensure its value and avoid duplication of work or
  unnecessary tool development.
- Upon approval, we will work with Amazon to create the repository.

Personal Repositories:

In the interim, personal repositories can be created (**assuming your organization’s governance allows for it**) and
community collaborators can be invited to contribute. This approach mitigates friction and allows for parallel effort
while awaiting repository approvals.

Upon creation of the repository, the source repository can be merged into the new repository. All repositories must
adhere and include the Apache 2.0 License.

This process provides the required governance and is essential to adhere to Amazon’s established procedures. The
formalized system offers several benefits:

Amazon’s ongoing support for the initiative through the GitHub organization, program tooling, community meetups, and
marketing events.

- As a community, we collaborate to determine whether a repository should be established. This process offers the
  advantage of minimizing redundant efforts, as the community may be aware of existing tools or potential contributions
  before we create a new one.
- We have a formal procedure in place to ensure adherence to security best practices for code.
- Furthermore, we do not impede our progress, as we retain the capability to work collaboratively on GitHub until we are
  prepared to formally contribute our code to the community.
