## Agentic-Community/community

🤖 Welcome to the Agentic Community

The Agentic Community is an open initiative focused on building practical, production-ready reference architectures and
implementations for agents that operate across systems, organizations, and levels of autonomy.

🧭 Key Factors:

- 🏗️ Vendor-neutral — focused on open patterns, not proprietary tools
- 🌐 Cross-organizational — designed for real-world coordination across teams and companies
- 🔍 Transparency-first — prioritizing observability, explainability, and governance
- ⚙️ Production-minded — our patterns and reference architectures are meant to be deployed, not just demoed

We’re here to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-grade agentic systems—through community-driven
collaboration, working groups, and hands-on code.
