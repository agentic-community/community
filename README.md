## 🤖 Agentic Community

A collaborative open initiative by member organizations to bridge AI research and enterprise reality through practical
agent applications

## ❓The Challenge We're Solving

Agentic AI has surpassed our understanding of designing scalable, trustworthy, and maintainable agent systems. The
Agentic Community initiative brings together practitioners to share, debate, and refine design patterns, evaluation
strategies, and capability-first approaches for architecting and developing agentic systems. Our goal is to help
organizations transition from agent experimentations to successful agent deployments.

## Our Focus: Business-First Agent Applications

We're a **collaborative initiative** focused on practical agent applications using existing, open source tools, cloud
services, frameworks and standards. As this field is still developing, we may find an area that is under served for us
to contribute through code contributions or thought leadership. We aim to address the following:

🤖 Agent Autonomy

* Decision framework for rules based vs LLM augmented vs Agent implementation
* Autonomy levels and risk assessment
* Real-world case studies and patterns
* Implementation guidelines by autonomy tier

🔗 Multi-Agent Architecture

* Single vs multi-agent decision criteria
* Model selection strategies (fixed vs dynamic)
* Self-organizing agent patterns
* Orchestration and coordination considerations and patterns

Future-Ready Design

* Protocol-agnostic architecture patterns
* Component isolation strategies
* Adaptation paths between protocols (MCP/A2A/ACP)
* Migration strategies for emerging technologies

🎛️ Enterprise Controls

* Transparency requirements by use case
* Audit mechanisms and logging standards
  * Control frameworks by trust level
* Compliance considerations

🔐 Security & Trust

* Security-first design principles
* Human oversight integration
* Value alignment verification
* Risk mitigation strategies

Standards & Interoperability

* Shape existing open source projects and standards critical for security, transparency, and interoperability

📦 Deliverables:

* An in-depth understanding of the agentic ecosystem leading to informed approaches in the form of white papers, blogs, patterns, and best-practices regarding agent development, interoperability, operations, and security.
* An architecture for building, testing, and deploying agents
* Collaborative and open problem-solving approach through shared experiences

🤝 Join the Community

* **Contribute Your Experience**: Share successful (and unsuccessful) agent implementations to help others learn
* **Collaborate on Patterns**: Join working groups focused on specific industries or use cases
* **Shape the Ecosystem**: Guide the evolution of tools and standards that enable secure, transparent, and interoperable agent systems

🏁 Getting Started

1. Read our [charter.md](charter.md) to understand our principles
2. Read our [onboarding](ONBOARDING.md) guide, attend a meeting, and introduce yourself
3. Join [discussions](https://github.com/agentic-community/community/discussions) to connect with practitioners and propose use cases or patterns

🧠 Your experience and perspective can help shape the future of agentic AI—collaboratively, transparently, and openly.
